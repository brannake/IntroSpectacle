            The idea behind Introspectiv is simple: you have room to grow
            in understanding yourself and what makes you happy.

            This app is a photo journal plugged into the IBM Watson supercomputer that
            analyzes your journal entries for emotional content.

            You can track changes in your mood over time, and find associations
            between changes in your mood and events described in your journal
            entries.

            Please see the videos below for instructions on how to access various features.
